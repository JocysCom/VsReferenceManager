# Jocys.com VS Reference Manager

Replace DLL references with project references.

## How it works.

Extension scans specified locations with projects. Then it will use that date to replace project DLL references with Project references. Projects will be added to solution under "References" solution folder.

## Update References with Projects

Before: Solution with Project4, which references two DLL assemblies:
<blockquote>
<img alt="Solution From" src="ReferenceManager/Documents/Images/Solution_From.png" width="330" height="220">
</blockquote>

Before: Solution with Project4, which references two Projects:

<img alt="Solution To" src="ReferenceManager/Documents/Images/Solution_To.png" width="330" height="220">
